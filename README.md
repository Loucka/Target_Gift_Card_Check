# Target_Gift_Card_Check
Beginning with a target gift card that was damaged while scratching to reveal the access pin, this project was aimed at brute-force determining the correct 8 digit access pin for a known card number. In this specific scenario, the last 4 digits were known so guesses were limited to 10,000 unique options.

Sadly, Target's prereq of a logged in session to check gift card balance makes this much more difficult. Furthermore, repeated attempts then yield additional email code verification and then ultimately a password reset. All of which makes the original $50 value of this card really not worth the effort.

Keen eyes will notice that the original card number and partial pin are present in this repo. While this was originally to be ommitted, I don't care at this point so should any other interested party be interested, have at it.
